## Goal

Make it visible which model was actually used for question extraction, so it's easy to spot if the expensive main model is being used instead of a cheap one.

## Where to show it

1. **Spinner** – update the loader text to include the model ID (e.g. `Extracting questions via claude-3-5-haiku-20241022...`). Since this is ephemeral, it's a nice-to-have but not sufficient on its own.
2. **Q&A form footer** – add the model ID to the controls/footer line in `QnAComponent`. This is the persistent, less ephemeral display.

## What to show

Just the model ID string (e.g. `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`), no provider prefix needed. Styled dim/muted so it stays unobtrusive.

## Implementation notes

- The model used is only known after extraction succeeds (since candidates are tried in order). Thread the successful candidate's `model.id` back from `doExtract` / the extraction phase.
- Pass the model ID into `QnAComponent` so it can render it in the footer.
- For the spinner: update the loader text after extraction succeeds but before the spinner closes (or include the candidate being tried in the spinner text as it attempts each one).
