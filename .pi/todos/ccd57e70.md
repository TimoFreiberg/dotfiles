Removed 3 redundant description strings from the answer tool's JSON schema:
- `question`: "The question text" → removed (obvious from property name)
- `context`: "Optional context to help the user answer" → removed (obvious)
- `questions` array: "List of questions to ask the user" → removed (obvious)

Kept the tool description unchanged — it's useful for the model to know when to use this tool vs inline questions. The tool registration is needed (not just /answer command) since the model calls it directly.
