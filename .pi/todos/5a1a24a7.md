Removed redundant descriptions from TaskItem properties (agent, task) and SubagentParams.tasks array. The property names are self-explanatory. Mentioned `{agent, task}` shape in tool description to compensate. The local extension was already simplified vs upstream (no chain/agentScope/cwd/confirmProjectAgents params).

Token savings:
- Removed 3 description strings from JSON schema (~30 tokens)
- Shortened tool description slightly (~5 tokens)
