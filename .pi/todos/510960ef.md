## Context

In the pi todo extension, after creating a todo by pressing Enter, the UI stays open with the new todo visible in search results. The user must manually press Esc to dismiss.

## Expected Behavior

1. **Enter with non-empty title:** Create the todo, then immediately exit the todo extension menu (same as pressing Esc).
2. **Enter with empty title:** Do nothing — don't create a todo. Optionally show unobtrusive feedback indicating an empty todo won't be created.
3. **Escape:** Exit the menu without creating anything (unchanged from current behavior).
