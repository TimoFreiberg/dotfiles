Key tools

- [Fan Control](https://getfancontrol.com/) for setting up fans
  Last config is in "Dropbox/Documents/Fancontrol Config - userConfig.json"
- US International (no dead keys) keyboard layout: Use [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) to import the layout file, create an installer/dll from it and run that.
- undervolting with [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) and [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/)
  - Curve so far: default curve pulled up to set 975mV to 2775 MHz, flat after that. Got at least one game crash so use a less aggressive one next time
