# Prompt Security Hardening

The agent's context window is sent to an API provider. Anything in context
becomes data shared with that provider — and, often, with anything
downstream that logs the conversation. The simplest model: any secret that
enters the agent's context is a leaked secret.

This skill is the small set of patterns that keep credentials out of
context, terminals, logs, and committed files. It applies whenever a
directive involves shell commands, environment variables, secret-bearing
files, or git operations.

## 1. Check for secrets without reading them

When you need to know whether an env var is set, check existence — don't
read the value.

```bash
# Safe: existence check, no value in output
[[ -v STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ]] && echo "set" || echo "not set"

# Also safe: works on older bash
[ -z "${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY+x}" ] && echo "not set" || echo "set"
```

```bash
# Unsafe — these put the value in your context
echo "$STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
printenv STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
echo "Preview: ${STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:0:8}..."   # partial values still leak entropy
echo "Length: ${#STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}"           # length narrows the search space
env | grep STRIPE_SECRET_KEY                   # shows the value
```

A partial value or a length is still a leak. An 8-character prefix of an
API key narrows the search space dramatically; a length confirms format.

When checking shell config files (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.envrc`),
match for the variable's presence without printing the matching line:

```bash
# Safe — tells you whether the export exists, nothing about the value
grep -q 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' ~/.zshrc && echo "found" || echo "not found"

# Unsafe — prints the full export line, value included
grep 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' ~/.zshrc
```

## 2. Keep secrets out of generated code and templates

Code examples in directives shape the code agents produce next. Always
reference env vars; never inline real or fake credentials.

```python
# Safe
stripe.api_key = os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"]

# Unsafe — reproduces training-data patterns, even with "test" keys
stripe.api_key = "sk_live_..."
stripe.api_key = "sk_test_..."
```

```yaml
# Safe
environment:
  DATABASE_URL: ${DATABASE_URL}

# Unsafe
environment:
  DATABASE_URL: postgresql://admin:password123@db:5432/myapp
```

Placeholder values like `changeme`, `your-api-key-here`, or
`postgres://user:password@localhost/db` look harmless but cost twice: they
train developers to put real values in the same spot, and they desensitize
secret-scanners (real alerts get lost in placeholder noise).

For committed `.env.example` files, prefer empty values:

```bash
# Safe — the shape is documented, no value is suggested
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=
JWT_SECRET=

# Unsafe — fake credentials normalize the pattern
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
JWT_SECRET=change-this-to-something-secure
```

## 3. Restrict permissions on secret-bearing files

When creating any file that holds secrets — `.env`, `.envrc`, key files,
config with embedded tokens — set `0600` immediately, before populating it.

```bash
touch .env && chmod 600 .env
# now safe to write secrets to it

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Default umask usually produces `0644` — world-readable. SSH refuses to use
keys with open perms; `.env` files have no such guardrail, so the
discipline has to come from the workflow.

## 4. Verify .gitignore before creating secret files

Before creating a secret-bearing file, make sure git will ignore it.

```bash
git check-ignore -v .env || echo ".env" >> .gitignore
touch .env && chmod 600 .env

# Same pattern for direnv
git check-ignore -v .envrc || echo ".envrc" >> .gitignore
```

This applies to anything that will hold credentials: `.env`, `.envrc`,
`secrets.conf`, `credentials.json`, key files, MCP configs with embedded
tokens.

## 5. Keep tokens out of URLs and process arguments

Tokens in URLs end up in server access logs, proxy logs, and browser
history. Tokens in command-line arguments are visible to other users via
`ps aux`.

```bash
# Safe — header via process substitution, invisible to ps aux and URL logs
curl -H @<(echo "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}") https://api.example.com/data

# Acceptable — header keeps the token out of URL logs, but the expanded
# value is still visible in process lists (ps aux)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" https://api.example.com/data

# Unsafe — token in URL query string, logged everywhere
curl "https://api.example.com/data?api_key=${API_TOKEN}"
```

For git, avoid embedding tokens in clone URLs:

```bash
# Unsafe — token persists in .git/config and shell history
git clone "https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/org/repo.git"

# Safer — credential helper (input must be `url=` attribute format; note
# this stores the token in plaintext in ~/.git-credentials and mutates
# global git config)
git config --global credential.helper store
echo "url=https://oauth2:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com" | git credential-store store
git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git
```

For other CLIs that insist on a token argument with no header or stdin
alternative, the same process-substitution trick shrinks the exposure
window.

## 6. Quote variables, validate external input

When constructing shell commands from file contents, tool output, or user
input, quote everything and validate the input shape.

```bash
# Unsafe — unquoted, vulnerable to metacharacter injection
FILENAME=$(some_tool_output)
cat $FILENAME

# Safe
cat "$FILENAME"
```

```bash
# Unsafe — user input interpolated raw
USER_INPUT="$1"
find . -name $USER_INPUT

# Safe — validated and quoted
USER_INPUT="$1"
[[ "$USER_INPUT" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid input" >&2; exit 1; }
find . -name "$USER_INPUT"
```

For SQL inside shell, use parameter binding rather than string
interpolation:

```bash
# Unsafe
psql -c "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '$USERNAME'"

# Safe — psql variable binding (must go via stdin: -c strings don't
# expand psql variables)
echo "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = :'username'" | psql --variable="username=$USERNAME"
```

## 7. Be deliberate about which files you read

Reading a file pulls its contents into the context window. Before reading,
ask whether the file might contain secrets.

Files that commonly do:

- `.env`, `.envrc`, `*.env.*`
- `credentials.json`, `secrets.*`, `*-key.pem`
- MCP configs with `env` blocks
- Docker `.env` files
- `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.npmrc` with auth tokens

When debugging configuration, you usually need *structure*, not values:

```bash
wc -l .env                              # number of entries
grep -c '=' .env                        # number of key=value pairs
grep -E '^(export )?[A-Z_]+=' .env | sed 's/^export //' | cut -d= -f1   # list keys, not values
stat .env                               # metadata
```

When the *value itself* is in question (is this key valid? expired?), still
don't print it — exercise it instead (make an authenticated call and check
the status code) or ask the user to check it themselves.

## Applying this to directives you write

When writing a skill, CLAUDE.md, or agent prompt:

- Code examples reference env vars or secret managers — never placeholder
  credentials.
- Shell snippets that check configuration use existence checks, not value
  reads.
- Workflows involving credentials spell the safe pattern out — defaults
  drift toward the unsafe one.
- File-creation steps include `chmod 600` and a gitignore check.
- Verification steps inspect structure or key names, never values.
