# Polytoken in Herdr

`herdr-polytoken` bridges Polytoken's built-in Herdr status reporter to `herdr-core` with OSC 7501. Outside a `herdr-core` terminal, it runs Polytoken without changing its environment. Inside one, it sets the Herdr reporter variables. It does not install hooks, change permissions, or manage session history. `hpt` remains a compatibility command for callbacks from sessions started under the old name.

Fish's `pt` abbreviation expands to `herdr-polytoken`. Start a new shell or run `abbr --add --global pt herdr-polytoken` in an existing Fish shell.

`programs.json` adds Polytoken to Herdr's agent menu as `herdr-polytoken new`. In the default layout, open the menu with the + beside the top tab bar; in the workspace tree layout, use the + on a space. Then select Polytoken. This adds Polytoken without replacing Herdr's default fallback shell. The full-color icon comes from [sjennings/polytoken-herdr-core](https://github.com/sjennings/polytoken-herdr-core/blob/0704710dc89c4b4dffd486a5dc644f3ec421c7ce/assets/polytoken.webp). A chezmoi template includes it as a regular file in Herdr's home because external icon symlinks are not supported.

The `keys.json` terminal binding sends ESC CR for Shift-Enter, which Polytoken accepts as a newline. It applies to terminal panes; plain Enter remains unchanged, and Cmd-Shift-Enter still zooms the pane. Remove the `shift-enter` entry to remove the workaround. The key file also contains macOS Cmd shortcuts, so chezmoi deploys it only on macOS and leaves Linux shortcuts unchanged.

The real scripts and configuration live in this repository. The entries under `home/` deploy them with chezmoi. Apply only these targets when installing:

```sh
chmod +x "$HOME/dotfiles/bin/herdr-polytoken" "$HOME/dotfiles/bin/hpt"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/polytoken-icons"
chezmoi apply "$HOME/.local/bin/herdr-polytoken" "$HOME/.local/bin/hpt" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/programs.json" "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/keys.json" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/polytoken-icons/polytoken.webp"
```

Back up existing unmanaged files before replacing them; do not force a whole-home apply. Herdr reloads configuration live and writes `programs.error` or `keys.error` if it cannot load a file. The menu launcher needs `herdr-polytoken` and `polytoken` on its PATH.

Check the bridge without launching a real model:

```sh
bash -n bin/herdr-polytoken bin/hpt
shellcheck bin/herdr-polytoken bin/hpt
```

Status is advisory, not proof of task success. The bridge reports state and clears it, but does not report model or facet metadata, blocked-reason text, or implement legacy restore commands. Normal `polytoken continue` and retained session history are unchanged. The bridge does not arrange terminals started by subagents.

## Workspace tree layout

The `workspace-tree` layout lists tabs beneath collapsible spaces. Click a session to select it; use the chevron to fold a space, its + to start a terminal or installed agent there, and the top + to create a space. Right-click spaces or sessions for Herdr's menus. Files and Changes stay in the bottom tools; Settings and the command palette are there too. The sidebar boundary can be dragged. Herdr stores fold state and the representative terminal for each tab locally; explicit tab names take precedence. The active tab still uses Herdr's ordinary pane controls and terminal menus.

Install only the personal layout and mods, after checking for existing files of the same names:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/layouts" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-tree" "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-new"
chezmoi apply "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/layouts/workspace-tree.json" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/layouts/workspace-tree.svg" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-tree/main.js" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-tree/mod.json" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-new/main.js" \
  "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-new/mod.json"
herdr-app check "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-tree"
herdr-app check "$HOME/.config/herdr-app/mods/workspace-new"
herdr-app do layout.switch '{"name":"workspace-tree"}'
```

The included templates deploy regular files because Herdr cannot load external mod assets. Switch back with `herdr-app do layout.switch '{"name":"main"}'`. The local behavior tests run with `node config/herdr-app/tests/workspace-ui.cjs`; they do not replace an in-app check. After a Herdr update, compare the shipped workspace and tab controls and capabilities, and add newly supported features without a dedicated home to the bottom tools as appropriate.

## Herdr compatibility mode

Polytoken's [orchestrator documentation](https://docs.polytoken.dev/using-polytoken/tui-orchestrators/) says that in Herdr mode it keeps the terminal in its default input mode to avoid duplicate keystrokes in Herdr panes and external editors. Modified keys such as Shift-Enter may arrive as their base key, and held-key repeats may not be distinguishable from fresh presses. The binding above sends ESC CR while keeping status reporting enabled.

The wrapper sets `HERDR_ENV=1`. Polytoken's documentation says a session started with this variable includes the shipped `herdr` skill, which helps the model inspect panes, coordinate sibling agents, and prompt them. This section follows the official documentation and does not verify that the local 0.9.2 source matches the installed 0.9.6 binary.
