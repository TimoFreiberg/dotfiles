## Version Control with jj

1. **Before starting work**, ensure the current change is empty by running `jj show`:
   - If there are uncommitted changes with no description, commit them with `jj commit -m "..."`
   - If there are uncommitted changes with a description, create a new change with `jj new`

2. **After making changes**, describe and commit with `jj commit -m "..."`
